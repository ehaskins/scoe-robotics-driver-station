The PS3 sixaxis controller sends data back as a USB HID device, given that a custom 
(aka "hacked together") driver is installed. Before the system can be run, the driver
must be downloaded.

The PS3 controller sends back data in the following data structure as quickly as 
possible. To form support, the project referenced by the links at the top of the page
creates a thread upon connection events which repeatedly feeds a global instance of
this structure, which the host program has managed read access to.

The structure for data is as follows:

Bits:	Byte:	Field:		Description:
8	0	ReportID	The index of the "report" (similar to a packet ID).
8	1	LAnalogX	The X-value of the left analog stick.
8	2	LAnalogY	The Y-value of the left analog stick.
8	3	RAnalogX	The X-value of the right analog stick.
8	4	RAnalogY	The Y-value of the right analog stick.
8	5	???		0x41
8	6	???		0x45
1	7	Triangle	The /\ button state. (Mask: 0x01)
1	-	Circle		The () button state. (Mask: 0x02)
1	-	Cross		The >< button state. (Mask: 0x04)
1	-	Square		The [] button state. (Mask: 0x08)
1	-	L2		The L2 button state. (Mask: 0x10)
1	-	R2		The R2 button state. (Mask: 0x20)
1	-	L1		The L1 button state. (Mask: 0x40)
1	-	R1		The R1 button state. (Mask: 0x80)
1	8	Select		The Select button state. (Mask: 0x01)
1	-	LAnalogClick	The Left Analog Click button state. (Mask: 0x02)
1	-	RAnalogClick	The Right Analog Click button state. (Mask: 0x04)
1	-	Start		The Start button state. (Mask: 0x08)
4	-	DPad		The D-pad button states. (Up: 0x10, Right: 0x30, Down: 0x50, Left: 0x70)
40	9-12	???		5 bytes of unused space.
8	13	UpAnalog	The ^ analog state.
8	14	RightAnalog	The > analog state.
8	15	DownAnalog	The v analog state.
8	16	LeftAnalog	The < analog state.
8	17	L2Analog	The L2 analog state.
8	18	R2Analog	The R2 analog state.
8	19	L1Analog	The L1 analog state.
8	20	R1Analog	The R1 analog state.
8	21	TriangleAnalog	The /\ analog state.
8	22	CircleAnalog	The () analog state.
8	23	CrossAnalog	The >< analog state.
8	24	SquareAnalog	The [] analog state.
120	25-39	???		15 bytes of unused space.
16	40-41	MotionX		The sixaxis motion X-value (0x40: high, 0x41: low)
16	42-43	MotionY		The sixaxis motion Y-value (0x42: high, 0x43: low)
16	44-45	MotionZ		The sixaxis motion Z-value (0x44: high, 0x45: low)
